- 👋 Hi, I’m Ahmed Emad
- 👀 I’m interested in Robotics Engineering

- 🌱 I'm currently working as an R&D Robotics Engineer in a company that works on numerous robotics projects in the Middle East. I primarily work on the motion and path planning of robotic arms using ROS and Python programming . I also used to work on a path planning method to improve the path of a self-driving car for a Formula Student racing team using ROS and Python programming.


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in the robotics industry
- 📫 You can reach me on my email (ahmeddemad53@gmail.com)
